{"q_question":"At about 5:30 A.M. of September 15, 2019, Police Senior Inspector Officer A of the Manila Police District Station received a text message from an unidentified civilian informer that one Mr. Z would be meeting up later that morning with two (2) potential sellers of drugs at a nearby restaurant. As such, Officer A decided to hang around the said place immediately.\r\n\r\nAt about 9:15 A.M., two (2) male passengers, named X and Y, who were each carrying a travelling bag, alighted from a bus in front of the restaurant. A transport barker, serving as a lookout for Officer A, signaled to the latter that X and Y were \"suspicious looking.\" As the two were about to enter the restaurant, Officer A stopped them and asked about the contents of their bags. Dissatisfied with their response that the bags contained only clothes, Officer A proceeded to search the bags and found packs of shabu therein. Thus, X and Y were arrested, and the drugs were seized from them. According to Officer A, a warrantless search was validly made pursuant to the stop and frisk rule; hence, the consequent seizure of the drugs was likewise valid.\r\n\r\nWas the stop and frisk rule validly invoked by Officer A? If not, what is the effect on the drugs seized as evidence? Explain. ","q_answer":"It is submitted that Officer A could not have validly conducted a valid stop and frisk search.\r\n\r\nIt bears emphasis that he approached X and Y, both of whom had just alighted from the bus and were about to enter the restaurant, simply by reason of a \"signal\" from the lookout, the barker, to the effect that they were \"suspicious-looking.\" There is no showing that Officer A actually found them to be such, or suspicious looking. It is clear that, insofar as Officer A was concerned, there was no observable manifestation that could have aroused his suspicion as to cause him to stop and frisk X and Y. To reiterate, the latter were merely entering a restaurant after they got off the bus when they were stopped by Officer A. (People v. Aruta, G.R. No. 120915, April 3, 1998)\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the drugs, having been unlawfully seized from X and Y in the course of an invalid warrantless search, should be considered as inadmissible in evidence against them.","course_name":"Political Law"},

There must be either (1) legal impossibility, or (2) physical impossibility of accomplishing the intended act in order to qualify the act as an impossible crime. Legal impossibility occurs where the intended acts, even if completed, would not amount to a crime. (Jacinto vs. People, G.R.

Explain briefly.","q_answer":"No, the contention of the parents is not tenable.\r\nThe K-12 Law is not violative of the equal protection clause.\r\nThe equal protection clause, which is directed princi pally against undue favor and individual or class privilege, is not intended to prohibit legislation which is limited to the object to which it is directed or by the territory in which it is to operate. It does not require absolute equality, but\r\nmerely that all persons be treated alike under like conditions both as to privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. The equal protection clause of the Constitution does not forbid classification for so long as such classification is based on real and substantial differences having a reasonable relation to the subject of the particular legislation. If classification is germane to the purpose of the law, concerns all members of the class, and applies equally to present and future conditions, the classification does not violate the equal protection guarantee.

In 2019, residents of Manila filed a complaint against MWC with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources Pollution Adjudication Board for violation of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The residents alleged that the severe flooding in Manila and worsening pollution in Manila Bay had been due to the failure of MWC to provide for adequate sewage and\/or septage treatment facilities, as mandated under the concession agreement.

Explain your answer. \r\n","q_answer":"The proclamation is unconstitutional. The President cannot, by mere proclamation and without an enabling law, grant tax exemptions and incentives. Such power is reserved to Congress under Article VI, Section 28(4) of the 1987 Constitution. The proper procedure would be for Congress to pass a law granting such exemptions and incentives, which the President may then implement.\r\n","course_name":"Taxation"},

Effectively zero-rated transactions, however, refer to the sale of goods or supply of services to persons or entities whose exemption under special laws or international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory effectively subjects such transactions to zero rate.

Later, Yari learned through friends that Malou is flaunting her boyfriend in social media. Yari discovered that Bobby is Malou's long-time boyfriend, and that they just pretended to be siblings. Yari filed a criminal complaint for violation of Republic Act No. 9262 or the Anti-Violence Against Women and their Children Act of 2004 (Anti-VAWC) against Malou and Bobby. As supporting evidence, Yari submitted a medical report which diagnosed her with major depressive disorder with symptoms of psychosis. At the trial, Malou argued that she is not criminally liable because the Anti-VAWC law is inapplicable to homosexual relationships. On the other hand, Bobby contended that the law is inapplicable to him because he is not in a relationship with Yari. Are Malou and Bobby criminally liable for violation of the Anti-VAWC law?

No. 179267, June 25, 2013 where there is no merit to the contention that R.A. 9262 singles out the husband or father as the culprit. As defined, violence against women and their children\" refers to any act or a series of acts committed by any person against a woman who is his wife, former wife, or against a woman with whom the person has or had a sexual or dating relationship. Clearly, the use of the gender-neutral word \"person who has or had a sexual or dating relationship with the woman encompasses even lesbian relationships.\r\n\r\n     As Yari suffered mental and emotional anguish because of her separation from Malou who flaunts her long-time boyfriend Bobby in social media and pretended to be siblings, both Malou and Bobby had community of design and purpose in tormenting her which can give rise to a criminal liability for violation of R.A. 9262 under the principle of conspiracy under the Revised Penal Code (RPC).

(5 points)\r\n","q_answer":"Yes, Sabrina acted in Self-Defense.\r\n\r\n     Self-defense requires the following: (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person resorting to self-defense.\r\n\r\n     Sabrina acted in self-defense from the attack made against her person by Camila. The fact that she surprised Camila in the act of sexual intercourse with Camila's husband is immaterial.

The trial court ruled that Adele took advantage of her position as a cashier which entails high degree of confidence because it involves handling of the properties of the employer. Did the trial court properly convict Adele of qualified theft? Explain.\r\n","q_answer":"The trial Court is not correct in convicting Adele for Qualified Theft.\r\n\r\n     In qualified theft, the taking must be the result of a relation by reason of dependence, guardianship, or vigilance, between the accused and the offended party that has created a high degree of confidence between them. Thus, grave abuse of confidence by a thieving employee should be contextualized not only by the relationship between the employer and employee, but also by the purpose for which the employee was given the employer's trust.\r\n\r\n     In this case, the fact that Adele was tasked to handle the properties of her employer do not show the circumstances of high degree of trust and confidence which and how she exploited to enrich herself to the damage and prejudice of her employer. Failure to allege and prove such element of Qualified Theft in the information, Adele should only be convicted of Simple Theft.\r\n\r\n     Note: The prosecution, likewise, failed to substantiate the gravity how Arlene betrayed Dr. Robillos' supposed special trust to qualify, or facilitate the taking of the money. Dr. Robillos principally hired Arlene as a clinic secretary while her task as a collector is foreign to her usual duties. The circumstances do not show that Arlene's job was instrumental in facilitating the taking of the money. There is no evidence that Arlene could not have committed the crime had she not been holding the position of a secretary or collector. To reiterate, abuse of confidence must be grave. On this point, the Court is convinced that Arlene took advantage of her position in committing the crime but not on the level of grave abuse of confidence.

Explain.\r\n","q_answer":"Harold is criminally liable for murder aggravated by Treachery.\r\n\r\n     Jurisprudence states that treachery can still be appreciated even though the victim was forewarned of the danger because what is decisive is that the attack was executed in a manner that the victim was rendered defenseless and unable to retaliate.\r\n\r\n     Even if Edward sensed that his life was in danger, when he was at church and praying for his safety, he was not in a position to defend himself as the attack made was sudden and unexpected, depriving the latter of any real chance to defend himself, the aggressor ensuring its commission without risk and without the slightest provocation on the part of the victim.\r\n\r\n     Note: The accused argues that there could not have beenany treachery because the victim knew the threat to his life. The Court has consistently held that treachery can still be appreciated even though the victim was forewarned of the danger because what is decisive is that the attack was executed in a manner that the victim was rendered defenseless and unable to retaliate. In this case, although it is true that the victim knew that the accused had a grudge against him, he never had any inkling that he would actually be attacked that night.

The declaration, however, is not admissible to prove that her husband indeed poisoned her. Even if she had lived and testified, her testimony would have been inadmissible for being an opinion and speculation; she merely thought or surmised that her husband had put poison in the noodles.

The prohibition must apply to bring back solidarity and harmony in their marital relationship.\r\nIs the marital disqualification rule applicable between Rigor and Marites? Explain. \r\n","q_answer":"No, the marital disqualification rule is not applicable between Rigor and Marites.\r\nThe Supreme Court has held that where there is no more harmony to be preserved nor peace and tranquility to be disturbed, the reason for the marital disqualification rule ceases and a spouse may testify against the other.\r\nHere, there is no more harmony to be preserved nor peace and tranquility to be disturbed because Rigor and Marites have separated due to irreconcilable differences and Rigor was living together with Lena as common law partners.\r\nHence, the marital disqualification rule is not applicable between Rigor and Marites.

Ray and Shane insisted that the sale of the land to them was both valid and enforceable.\nAre the contentions of the heirs of Alma tenable? Explain briefly.","q_answer":"No, the contentions of the heirs of Alma are untenable.\nFirst, an oral contract of sale is considered valid and binding between the contracting parties for as long as the three essential requisites of consent, object, and cause or consideration are present.

Explain briefly. (5 points)\n","q_answer":"\nAs among Aida, Lorna, and Fe, it is Lorna who owns the property.\n\nA contract of sale coupled with delivery to the buyer transfers the ownership of the thing sold to the buyer. [Article 1496, Civil Code] Under the law on Sales, delivery may be actual or constructive. When the sale is made through a public instrument. the execution thereof shall be equivalent to the delivery of the thing which is the object of the contract, if from the deed the contrary does not appear or cannot clearly be inferred. (Article 1498, Civil Code)\n\nHere, the contract of sale between Aida and Lorna was coupled with constructive delivery of the land to Loma, since the sale was executed in a public instrument. Thus, ownership was already transferred to Loma. The nonpayment of the full purchase price is irrelevant since it is not required for the transfer of ownership to the buyer in an absolute sale. Aida, being no longer the owner after the sale and delivery to Loma, could not transfer ownership to Fe.\n\nHence, it is Lorna who owns the property.\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\n\nThe case appears to be one of double sale. The owner of the property will be the buyer who first registered the sale in the Registry of Property. Under the rules on double sale, if the same immovable property be sold to different vendees, the ownership shall belong to the person acquiring it who in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of Property. If there is no registration, the ownership shall pertain to the person who in good faith was first in possession; and in the absence thereof to the person who presents the oldest title provided there is good faith.

Explain briefly.","q_answer":"Laica's position is tenable.\n\nThe imposition of an unconscionable rate of interest on a money debt, even if knowingly and voluntarily assumed, is immoral and unjust. Interest rates must be viewed merely as compensation to the creditor for money lent to another which he or she could have otherwise used for his or her own purposes at the time it was lent. As such, the interest rates must be reasonable and should not be a means for predatory gain. (Megalopolis Properties Inc. v. D'Nhew Lending Corporation, G.R. No. 243891, May 7, 2021)\nThe interest rate of 10% per month imposed by Laica which translates to 120 percent per annum or twenty times the legal rate of interest is clearly excessive and unconscionable and while it may not be contrary to law, it is contrary to morals.\nThus, Laica should be held liable for legal interest from the date of default.\n","course_name":"Civil Law"},

Explain briefly.","q_answer":"No. PIC is not correct. PIC here is claiming the right which Anj originally had against the person causing the damage and such cause of action is based on a quasi-delict. Actions based on a quasi-delict must be instituted within a period of four years which must be reckoned from the time of the commission of the tort.

(Article 1303, Civil Code)\n\nFollowing the principles of subrogation, PIC, as the insurer, only steps into the shoes of the insured Anj and therefore, for purposes of prescription, inherits only the remaining period within which the insured may file an action against the wrongdoer. The indemnification of the insured by the insurer only allows it to be subrogated to the former's rights and does not create a new reckoning point for the cause of action that the insured originally has against the wrongdoer.

{"q_question":"Gio, single, joined a marathon organized by Takbo Co. For lack of alternative routes, the marathon course included a public road which was not blocked-off from vehicles. Takbo Co. solicited the sponsorship of Kotse Corp. for added financial support. Gio was hit by a jeepney driven by JD on the public road and died. The parents of Gio sued Takbo Co. and Kotse Corp. for damages. The court ruled that Kotse Corp. is solidarily liable for damages with Takbo Co. for being one of the principal movers of the event due to its sponsorship.\nIs the court correct? Explain briefly.","q_answer":"No, the court is not correct. To be liable for damages, the act or omission of the defendant must be the proximate cause of the resulting injury to the plaintiff. There must be proof of negligence and that the damage caused was the consequence of the negligence of the defendant.\nIn this case, Kotse Corporation merely sponsored the event. Kotse Corporation's mere sponsorship of the marathon was, legally speaking, too remote to be the efficient and proximate cause of the injurious consequences. (Abrogar vs. Cosmos Bottling Corp., G.R. No. 164749, March 15, 2017) There was no statement in the facts of the case that Kotse Corporation was involved in the actual conduct of the race or that it was guilty of negligence. Thus, it cannot be held liable for the resulting death of Gio. The liability for the death may be attributed solely to the organizer Takbo Co. for its negligence in failing to put up measures to ensure the safety of the participants in the marathon.\n","course_name":"Civil Law"},
{"q_question":"Eka, a Filipina, and Du-guil, a Korean, married in the Philippines. Thereafter, they moved to Seoul, South Korea. While there, Du-guil began to ignore Eka. He was always out with his friends and usually came home drunk. When Eka could not take their marital situation anymore, she asked for a divorce. Du-guil agreed on the condition that Eka would be the one to file for divorce, and that the ground should be \"no fault\", meaning, neither of them is at fault or neither would be accused of any wrongdoing. After the divorce, Eka went back to the Philippines and filed a case to have the judgment of divorce recognized. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) denied Eka's petition because she alone filed for divorce, in violation of the second paragraph of Article 26 of the Family Code. According to the RTC, Article 26 requires that either the foreign spouse alone initiates the filing of the divorce or, at the very least. Eka and Du-guil should have filed for divorce jointly.\n\nIs the RTC correct? Explain briefly.","q_answer":"No, the RTC is not correct. As ruled by the Court in Republic v. Manalo, it is irrelevant if the foreign or the Filipino spouse initiated the foreign divorce proceeding. Once a divorce decree is issued, the foreign spouse is deemed to have 'obtained' a divorce which capacitates him or her to remarry.\n\nFurther in Abel v. Rule, (G.R. No. 234457, May 12. 2021) reiterating Galapon v. Republic, (G.R.

Oliver's land had no direct access to the highway, as it was blocked by a kamote plantation owned by Josh. Phil's subdivision, on the other hand, already has a direct access to the highway. To facilitate the release of the license from the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development, Oliver presented a contract to sell between him and Josh over the kamoteplantation, on the representation that he would construct an access road thereon.\nPending approval of the license, Oliver sought the consent of Phil to connect the road that would be built by him with the main road of Phil's subdivision. Phil allowed him to do this pending their negotiation on the compensation to be paid. With the eventual grant of the license, Oliver began the development of his subdivision. To present the right of way over Phil's subdivision, Oliver was able to cause an annotation of adverse claim on Phil's property.\nHowever, when Oliver's subdivision was already completed, and with the adverse claim annotated, Oliver believed that he no longer needed to buy the kamoteplantation and accordingly rescinded the contract to sell with Josh.\nWhen Oliver and Phil failed to arrive at an agreement on the consideration for the easement, Phil built a wall blocking the road constructed by Oliver that connected Oliver's subdivision with his.

Lot 1 remained empty until the spouses Cruz started the construction of a two-storey residential house thereon in 2018.\nThe house constructed on Lot 1 being taller than the spouses Santos' one-storey residential house, the spouses Cruz's two-storey residential house obstructed the light, air, and view of the spouses Santos residential house. The spouses Santos bemoaned how, prior to the construction on Lot 1, they received enough bright and natural light from their windows. The construction rendered their house dark such that they are unable to do their normal activities in their house without switching on their lights.\nHave the spouses Santos acquired an easement of light view with respect to Lot 1 owned by the spouses Cruz?

In his defense, JR insisted that he could not be held criminally liable for Bigamy because his marriage with Inka in 1981 is void for lack of a valid marriage license, while his marriage with Elena is void for lack of a marriage ceremony. Meanwhile, Elena claimed that even prior to the Bigamy case, she already filed a petition for nullity of marriage before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City sometime in 2007 after learning about the marriage between JR and Inka. The RTC later declared the marriage of JR and Elena as void for being bigamous, and the ruling attained finality due to lack of appeal. Does JR have a valid defense in the Bigamy case? Decide with reasons.\n","q_answer":"Yes, JR has a valid defense in the bigamy case.\nArticle 40 of the Family Code provides that the absolute nullity of a previous marriage may be invoked for purposes of remarriage on the basis solely of a final judgment declaring such previous marriage void.\nIn the recent case of Pulido vs. People of the Philippines (G.R. No. 220149, July 27, 2021) which involves a similar set of facts as in the problem presented, the Supreme Court ruled that the requirement of seeking a judicial declaration of nullity of a previous marriage under Article 40 of the Family Code applies only for purposes of remarriage. It is not the intent of Article 40 to preclude an accused in a bigamy case from raising the nullity of his marriage as a defense in a bigamy case. It would, thus, be unfair if the accused will not be permitted to raise such nullity in a prosecution for bigamy when the clear intent of Article 40 is to require such judicial decree of nullity only for the purpose of remarriage. Further in Pulido, the Court held that a judicial declaration of absolute nullity is not necessary to prove a prior or subsequent void ab initio marriage in a bigamy case.\nThus, JR has a valid defense in the bigamy case.\n","course_name":"Civil Law"},

The purchases were mainly due to the successful salon and water refilling business of Lucia. Unfortunately, the records of these purchases were destroyed during Typhoon Ondoy in 2009. In 2023, their relationship turned sour and Lucia now wants to part ways with Santiago. However, there is a disagreement on how to divide their properties. Lucia filed a case in the Family Court, claiming that she is entitled to all of the properties. Is Lucia correct? Explain briefly.","q_answer":"No, Lucia is not correct.\nUnder the Family Code, when a man a woman who are capacitated to marry each other live exclusively with each other as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage or under a void marriage, their wages and salaries shall be owned by them in equal shares and the property acquired by both of them through their work or industry shall be governed by the rules on co-ownership. In addition, there is also a presumption that the properties acquired while they lived together shall be presumed to have been obtained by their joint efforts, work or industry and shall be owned by them in equal shares.\nThe facts did not mention whether the parties are capacitated to marry each other or not. On the assumption that Santiago and Lucia are capacitated to marry each other, the provisions of Article 147 shall apply. Under the said provision even if one party did not participate in the acquisition by the other party of any property, such party shall still be entitled to a share if his or her efforts consisted in the care and maintenance of the household.

He arranged for Genevieve to reside in the Philippines and bought her a house in North Greenhills so that they could continue with their illicit affair. Juliette was born out of their affair. Juliette grew up not knowing that she was the illegitimate daughter of Melchor until the death of the latter. Upon discovering that her father had a legitimate family, Juliette sought to be recognized as an illegitimate daughter of Melchor since she had always longed for sisters. In her action to prove her illegitimate filiation, Juliette presented her birth certificate signed by Melchor, as well as photographs of her with Melchor in their home in North Greenhills. Amy, Anna, and Karenina opposed the action of Juliette.\nWill the action of Juliette prosper? Explain your answer.","q_answer":"Yes, the action of Juliette will prosper.\nUnder the law, an illegitimate child may prove his illegitimate filiation by any of the proofs of filiation mentioned in Article 172 of the Family Code like a record of birth appearing in the Civil Register, a public document acknowledging the child's filiation, or a private handwritten document signed by the parent concerned. In the absence of the foregoing documents, an illegitimate child may also prove his or her filiation by open and continuous possession of the status of an illegitimate child or any other means allowed by the Rules of Court like entries in family bible or act or declaration about pedigree. However, if the illegitimate child seeks to prove his or her filiation by open and continuous possession of such status, the action must be filed during the lifetime of the putative parent.\nIn the case presented, Juliette has a birth certificate which was duly signed by Melchor.

Grief-stricken, Jaime and Cathy now want to adopt Cesar and raise him as their own. Are they qualified under the law to adopt Cesar? Explain your answer. ","q_answer":"No, Jaime and Cathy are not qualified to adopt.\nUnder the new adoption law (Republic Act No. 11642) for a person to be qualified to adopt, he or she must at least by twenty-five (25) years of age and must be in possession of full civil capacity and legal rights among others. In addition, the adopter must at least be sixteen (16) years older than the adoptee and must be in a position to support and care for the adopted children in keeping with the means of the family.\nHere, Jaime and Cathy are only 21 years old and they do not satisfy the minimum age requirement under the law. Also, the sixteen year age gap between the adopter(s) and the adoptee was not satisfied since the child to be adopted is eight years old and the age gap between Jaime and Cathy and the child they seek to adopt is only thirteen (13) years.\nThus, Jaime and Cathy are not qualified to adopt for not satisfying the minimum age requirement and the age gap requirement under the adoption law.\n","course_name":"Civil Law"},

Anita was able to provide a house, a nanny, and other necessities for Marisol. Billy, however, insisted that Anita no longer needed to work if she and Marisol stayed with him as he could provide for them. Since Anita refused to live with Billy, the latter filed a petition for custody of Marisol. Anita contended that illegitimate children are automatically under the sole custody and parental authority of the mother. On the other hand, Billy alleged that Anita is unfit to take care of Marisol given her line of work. If you are the judge, how will you decide the petition? Explain.\n","q_answer":"If I were the judge, I will rule in favor of Anita.\nThe Family Code provides that illegitimate children shall be under the sole parental authority of the mother. (Article 176) In addition, under the matemal preference rule, no child below seven years of age shall be separated from the mother unless there are compelling reasons to do so.\nIn the case presented, Marisol is obviously an illegitimate child as she was born outside of wedlock to Anita and Billy. The child is also below seven years of age since the facts state that Anita went back to her job one year after giving birth to Marisol and it was at this time that Billy filed the custody petition. While even an illegitimate child may be separated from its mother if here is a compelling reason to do so, the instant case does not reveal that Anita is unfit to have custody of Marisol just because she works as an entertainer at a men's club. The Supreme Court in one case ruled that only the most compelling reasons shall justify the court's awarding of custody to someone other than the mother such as neglect, abandonment, unemployment, immorality, habitual drunkenness, and drug abuse.

They asked a mutual friend who was a law student to draw up a contract which reflected the mentioned interests. The contract also had a provision that their shares in the benefits as well as the charges affecting the property would be equal. They then found a long-term tenant who rented the property for P30,000 a month. Unfortunately, Niccolo and Meann broke up and are now quarreling over their respective shares in the rental income.

The parties here became co-owners of the condominium unit when they contributed the money for its purchase.\nThe law on co-ownership provides that the share of the co-owners in the benefits as well as in the charges shall be proportional to their respective interests and any stipulation in a contract to the contrary shall be void. (Civil Code, Article 485)\nIt was clearly stated in the facts that Niccolo contributed 2\/3 of the purchase price of the condominium unit while Meann contributed the other 1\/3.

Shortly after, the Spouses Cruz filed an ejectment case against Ildefonso and Bienvenido for the 1\/4 portion of the subject property that they purchased. On the other hand, Bienvenido filed a complaint for recovery of ownership, quieting of title, and annulment of deed of sale against the Spouses Cruz. He alleged that the deed of sale is void since Bugoy is not the true and real owner of the subject property, which originally belonged to the estate of Rufino. On the other hand, the Spouses Cruz argued that Bienvenido availed of the wrong remedy, and claimed that the heirs had already agreed to divide the property among themselves when they allowed a portion of the property to be occupied by the heirs of Arturo. Will the complaint of Bienvenido prosper? Discuss.\n","q_answer":"No, the complaint filed by Bienvenido will not prosper.\nAfter the death of the spouses Lani and Rufino, a state of co-ownership existed between their surviving children including Bugoy. While a co-owner has full-ownership of his part and is free to alienate, assign or mortgage it, he cannot sell the shares of the other co-owners (Article 493). Bugoy's sale of the 1\/4 property to the Spouses Cruz will only affect his pro-indiviso share but not the shares of the other co-owners who did not give their consent thereto.\nThus, the sale made by Bugoy is not void in its entirety but will transfer to the Spouses Cruz only Bugoy's ideal or pro-indiviso share in the property owned in common. The law provides that alienation or the mortgage made by a co-owner shall be limited to the portion which may be allotted to him in the division upon the termination of the co-ownership.

Each co-owner may demand at any time the partition of the thing owned in common insofar as his share is concerned. (Civil Code, Article 494; Reyes v. Garcia, G.R.

The true standard for the grant of the legal right is \"adequacy\", (Costabella Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R.

{"q_question":"EXIT Corp., no longer wanting to continue with its business, transferred to Entra, Inc. under an Asset Purchase Agreement all its properties and assets including goodwill. A creditor of EXIT Corp. demanded from Entra, Inc. the payment of EXIT Corp.'s debt for the reason that the transaction amounted to a merger and, therefore, the surviving corporation, Entra, Inc.,must assume the debts of the absorbed corporation, EXIT Corp.\r\n\r\nIs the creditor's demand tenable? Explain briefly. ","q_answer":"The creditor's demand is not tenable. The transaction did not amount to a merger which would have made Entra liable for the obligations of Exit Corporation. The Supreme Court ruled in Bank of Commerce v. Radio Philippine Network, Inc.  that there can be no merger if the requirements and procedure for merger were not observed and no certificate of merger was issued by the SEC.\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\n\nBased on the question, the emphasis appears to be whether or not the sale transaction amounts to a merger. However, given that the sale of all the assets includes the goodwill, the examinee may interpret the question as one that calls for the application of the business enterprise transfer rule which would make the buyer corporation liable for the obligations of the seller corporation.\n\nUnder the Nell Doctrine, so called because it was first pronounced by the Supreme Court in the 1965 ruling in Nell vs. Pacific Farms, Inc.,  the general rule is that where one corporation sells or otherwise transfers all of its assets to another corporation, the latter is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor.\nThe exceptions to the Nell doctrine are as follows:\n\na) When the buyer expressly or impliedly assumes the liabilities of the seller;\n\nb) If the sale amounts to a merger or consolidation;\n\nc) If the sale is entered into fraudulently or made in bad faith; and\n\nd) If the buyer is merely a continuation of the personality of the seller or the so called business-enterprise transfer rule. \n\nThe legal basis of the last in the four (4) exceptions to the Nell Doctrine, where the purchasing corporation is merely a continuation of the selling corporation, is challenging to determine.\n\nIn other words, in this last exception, the transferee purchases not only the assets of the transferor but also its business. As a result of the sale, the transferor is merely left with its juridical existence, devoid of its industry and earning capacity. Fittingly, the proper provision of law that is contemplated by this exception would be Section 39 of the RCC.\n\nThe purpose of the business-enterprise transfer is to protect the creditors of the business by allowing them a remedy against the new owner of the assets and business enterprise. Otherwise, creditors would be left \"holding the bag,\" because they may not be able to recover from the transferor who has \"disappeared with the loot,\" or against the transferee who can claim that he is a purchaser in good faith and for value\n","course_name":"Commercial Law"},

Do you agree with Atty. Irish? Explain your answer. ","q_answer":"Atty. Elvie was correct that Atty.

Irish at the execution sale, taking part in the bidding and negotiation of the payment of the judgment award constituted practice of law.

{"q_question":"Professor Chiara, a natural-born Filipino citizen, is a resident expert on global military affairs at the National Defense College where she taught for 12 years. In 2017, she was tenured as a faculty member at the leading military academy in the United Kingdom (UK). In April 2022, she was granted British citizenship. Having learned of the renowned expertise of Professor Chiara, the President invited her to return to the Philippines to be appointed as National Security Adviser. Upon her appointment, Professor Chiara took her oath of allegiance to the Philippines and renounced her allegiance to the UK. Not satisfied with these actions, Ramon, the spokesperson of a non-government organization monitoring national security affairs, demanded that Professor Chiara renounce her British citizenship. Is Ramon correct? Explain. ","q_answer":"Professor Chiara's renunciation of her allegiance to the United Kingdom coupled with her swearing of her allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines, can be considered as an effective renunciation of her British citizenship, thus making her solely a natural-born Philippine citizen and therefore eligible for appointment as the National Security Adviser.\r\n\r\nIt is established that the requirement of renunciation of foreign citizenship applies only to those with dual allegiance such as dual citizens whose foreign citizenship was acquired through naturalization or at their own volition. (Gana-Carait v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 257453, August 9, 2022) Only dual citizens by naturalization are required to take not only the Oath of Allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines but also to personally renounce foreign citizenship in order to terminate their dual citizenship. This would be particularly required for dual citizens who seek election to public office. (Macquling v. Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 195649, July 2, 2013)\r\n\r\nWith respect to dual citizens who became such through processes other than naturalization in another country or abroad or of their own volition, such as Professor Chiara who was merely \"granted British citizenship\" without her applying for the same, the swearing of allegiance to the Philippines constitutes an effective renunciation of any other citizenship or terminates dual citizenship. (See Mercado v. Manzano, G.R. No. 135083 May 26, 1999) It is to be noted that, in this case, Professor Chiara not only swore allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines but also \"renounced her allegiance to the UK.\" Said swearing of allegiance to the Philippines and renunciation of her allegiance to the United Kingdom necessarily terminated her status as a dual citizen, and entitled her to be considered eligible for the subject appointment.

Severino, the owner of the baganda non-paying passenger, consented to have it opened and it was revealed that the bag contained a firearm and a live grenade. When Severino failed to produce proof of his authority to carry firearms and explosives, he was arrested and eventually charged with Illegal Possession of Firearms and Explosives.

","q_answer":"No, Severino is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe inspection at the military checkpoint of the public transport bus, where the passengers can be considered as having a reduced expectation of privacy, and which, as shown in the facts, was done in a minimally intrusive manner, especially considering that Severino's bag was opened only after or upon his prior consent, can be considered as or was a reasonable search.

This visual and minimally intrusive inspection was even less than the standard x-ray and physical inspections done at the airport and seaport terminals where passengers may further be required to open their bags and luggages (sic).

At the same time, however, because these private premises are accessible to the public, the State, much like the owner, can impose non-intrusive security measures and filter those going in. The only difference in the imposition of security measures by an owner and the State is, the former emanates from the attributes of ownership under Article 429 of the Civil Code, while the latter stems from the exercise of police power for the promotion of public safety.

{"q_question":"The Zuri Republic and Wanda Republic are members of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). In 2024, the Permanent Court of Arbitration rejected Zuri Republic's claim over the entire South Wrigley Sea and declared it as part of Wanda Republic's exclusive economic zone. However, Zuri Republic refused to recognize the arbitral award and continued its reclamation activities. Thereafter, Xena Republic, a non-UNCLOS state, filed a protest against Zuri Republic before the United Nations Security Council to respect the arbitral award and to stop reclamation efforts that destroy the fragile ecosystem. The Zuri Republic then challenged the legal standing of Xena Republic and argued that only state parties to the UNCLOS can enforce the arbitral award. Does Xena Republic have legal standing to initiate the protest? Explain.","q_answer":"Yes, the Xena Republic may initiate and pursue the protest before the United Nations Security Council.\r\nUnder the Charter of the United Nations, any member of the United Nations may bring to the attention of its Security Council or of the General Assembly (Article 35) any dispute, or any situation of the nature which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute, in order to determine whether the continuance of the dispute or situation is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security. (Article 34)\r\nIt is submittted that the reclamation efforts of the Zuri Republic fall within the coverage of said authority of the United Nations Security Council, as all states have the \"responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.\" (See Section 21 of the Stockholm Declaration.) A breach of this duty \"might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute\" cognizable by the Security Council.\r\nMoreover, the claim that \"only state parties to the UNCLOS can enforce the arbitral award\" would be immaterial to the legal standing of the Xena Republic to pursue its protest before the Security Council.

{"q_question":"Omar, an Iranian national, was admitted in the Philippines as a refugee. After more than 10 years in the Philippines, Omar filed a petition for naturalization as a Filipino citizen. The trial court found that Omar possessed all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications to become a Filipino citizen. How-ever, the Office of the Solicitor General opposed the petition because the laws of Iran do not grant reciprocal rights to Filipinos to become naturalized citizens. Will the lack of the reciprocity requirement bar Omar's application for naturalization? Explain.","q_answer":"No, it should not.\r\nThe Philippines is a party to a treaty (1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees) which requires it to \"facilitate the assimilation and naturalization of refugees\" (Section 34), such as Omar, and expressly provides for an exemption from the subject reciprocity requirement (Section 7).\r\nIt has been held that our municipal or naturalization laws \"must be read in light of the developments in international human rights law, specifically the granting of nationality to refugees and stateless persons.\"\r\nAccordingly, the \"lack of the reciprocity requirement\" should not constitute a bar to Omar's naturalization.\r\n[Note: \"Considering the above disquisitions, the Court does not need to belabor the last issue on reciprocity between Iranian and Philippine laws on naturalization. True, the Naturalization Law disqualifies citizens or subjects of a foreign country whose laws do not grant Filipinos the right to become naturalized citizens or subjects. A perusal of Karbasi's petition, both with the RTC and the CA, together with his supplemental pleadings filed with the Court, however, reveals that he has successfully established his refugee status upon arrival in the Philippines. In effect, the country's obligations under its various international commitments come into operation. Articles 6 and 34 of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, to which the Philippines is a signatory, must be considered in this case, to wit:\r\n\"Article 6 of the 1951 Convention:\r\n\"For the purposes of this Convention, the term in the same circumstances' implies that any requirements (including requirements as to length and conditions of sojourn or residence) which the particular individual would have to fulfill for the enjoyment of the right in question, if he were not a refugee, must be fulfilled by him, with the exception of requirements which by their nature a refugee is incapable of fulfilling.\r\n\"Article 34 of the 1951 Convention:\r\n\"The Contracting States shall as far as possible facilitate the assimilation and naturalization of refugees. They shall in particular make every effort to expedite naturalization proceedings and to reduce as far as possible the charges and costs of such proceedings.\r\n\"In the same vein, Article 7 of the said Convention expressly provides exemptions from reciprocity, while Article 34 states the earnest obligation of contracting parties to 'as far as possible facilitate the assimilation and naturalization of refugees.' As applied to this case, Karbasi's status as a refugee has to end with the attainment of Filipino citizenship, in consonance with Philippine statutory requirements and international obligations. Indeed, the Naturalization Law must be read in light of the developments in international human rights law, specifically the granting of nationality to refugees and stateless persons.\" (Republic v.

{"q_question":"The Congress passed a law prohibiting the \"transmission of commercial electronic communications with the use of a computer system which seeks to advertise, sell, or offer products and services without prior consent of the recipient.\" The digital marketplace Buy and Ship Online (BSO) questioned the constitutionality of the law for being a class legislation because it specifically targets online businesses. The BSO added that the measure must be tested using the \"strict scrutiny test\" because it interferes with the exercise of fundamental rights since commercial advertisements are forms of free speech and expression. In contrast, the Office of the Solicitor General invoked the \"rational basis test\" and argued that the State has a legitimate interest to protect the public from unsolicited advertisements. Considering the levels of judicial scrutiny, what is the proper test to determine the constitutionality of the subject law?

Health Secretary, G.R. No. 173034, October 9, 2007.)\r\nWhile commercial speech, such as \"electronic communications with the use of a computer system,\" has been considered to be \"a separate category of speech which is not accorded the same level of protection as that given to other constitutionally guaranteed forms of expression,\" it is \"nonetheless entitled to protection.\"\r\nAccordingly, it has been held that \"to prohibit the transmission of unsolicited ads would deny a person the right to read his emails, even unsolicited commercial ads addressed to him. xxx.

Transmitting spams amounts to trespass to one's privacy since the person sending out spams enters the recipient's domain without prior permission. The OSG contends that commercial speech enjoys less protection in law.\r\n\"But, firstly, the government presents no basis for holding that unsolicited electronic ads reduce the 'efficiency of computers.' Secondly, people, before the arrival of the age of computers, have already been receiving such unsolicited ads by mail. These have never been outlawed as nuisance since people might have interest in such ads. What matters is that the recipient has the option of not opening or reading these mail ads.

Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, the U.S. Supreme court struck down a law prohibiting the advertising of prices for prescription drugs. It held that price information was important to consumers, and that the First Amendment protects the 'right to receive information' as well as the right to speak. It ruled that consumers have a strong First Amendment interest in the free flow of information about goods and services available in the marketplace and that any state regulation must support a substantial interest.\r\n\"Central Hudson Gas & Electric v. Public Service Commission is the watershed case that established the primary test for evaluating the constitutionality of commercial speech regulations. In this landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the regulation issued by the Public Service Commission of the State of New York, which reaches all promotional advertising regardless of the impact of the touted service on overall energy use, is more extensive than necessary to further the state's interest in energy conserva-tion. In addition, it ruled that there must be a showing that a more limited restriction on the content of promotional advertising would not adequately serve the interest of the State. In applying the First Amendment, the U.S. Court rejected the highly paternalistic view that the government has complete power to suppress or regulate commercial speech.\r\n\"Central Hudson provides a four-part analysis for evaluating the validity of regulations of commercial speech.

Obviously to be included in this category are those who have achieved some degree of reputation by appearing before the public, as in the case of an actor, a professional baseball player, a pugilist, or any other entertainer. The list is, however, broader than this.

(De la Cruz v. People, G.R. No. 209387, January 17, 2016; see People v. Marti, G.R. No. 81561, January 18, 1991, 271 Phil. 51 [1991]; Marquez v. People, G.R. No. 197207, March 13, 2013, 693 SCRA 468; Cadajas v. People, G.R. No. 247348, November 16, 2021)\r\nThe facts indicate that the pictures and videos constituting evidence against Kenneth were obtained by the next customer, presumably a private individual, who merely reported the same to police authorities. Kenneth's negligence in forgetting to log out of his account necessarily resulted in a reduction of his expectation of privacy with respect to the contents thereof.\r\nIt therefore cannot be tenably claimed that the police authorities did the search and the seizure of said evidence and that the rules against unreasonable or warrantless searches and seizures were violated.\r\n[Note: In this case, the photographs and conversations in the Facebook Messenger account that were obtained and used as evidence against petitioner, which he considers as fruit of the poisonous tree, were not obtained through the efforts of the police officers or any agent of the State. Rather, these were obtained by a private individual. Indeed, the rule governing the admissibility of an evidence under Article III of the Constitution must affect only those pieces of evidence obtained by the State through its agents. It is these individuals who can flex government muscles and use government resources for a possible abuse. However, where pri-vate individuals are involved, for which their relationship is governed by the New Civil Code, the admissibility of an evidence cannot be deter-mined by the provisions of the Bill of Rights. (Cadajas u. People, G.R. No. 247348, November 16, 2021)]\r\n[Acceptable Answer: No, they are not admissible.\r\nIt is submitted that the information relayed or report made by the next customer on the subject pictures and videos could have only been basis or can only be considered as probable cause for the proper application by the police authorities for a search warrant, which in turn would provide for the admissibility of the same as evidence against Kenneth.\r\nIt is further submitted that Kenneth's negligence in having failed to log out from his \"social media account\" cannot be considered as resulting in his reduced expectation of privacy, which may justify the subject warrant-less search and seizure, as the same cannot or should not necessarily be considered as his having (expressly and voluntarily) authorized or granted anyone access to his said account, and the subject pictures and videos. (See Cadajas v. People, G.R. No. 247348, November 16, 2021)\r\nAccordingly, the \"seizure\" of the subject evidence under the circumstances so indicated should be considered as having been done in violation of the rules against unreasonable searches and seizures.]\r\n[Note: \"Here, petitioner's expectation of privacy emanates from the fact that his Facebook Messenger account is password protected, such that no one can access the same except himself. Petitioner never asserted that his Facebook Messenger account was hacked or the photos were taken from his account through unauthorized means. Rather, the photos were obtained from his account because AAA, to whom he gave his password, had access to it. Considering that he voluntarily gave his password to AAA, he, in effect, has authorized AAA to access the same. He did not even take steps to exclude AAA from gaining access to his account. Having been given authority to access his Facebook Messenger account, petitioner's reasonable expectation of privacy, in so far as AAA is concerned, had been limited. Thus, there is no violation of privacy to speak of.\r\n\"While the messages and photos were taken from the Facebook Messenger of petitioner because AAA was forced by BBB to do so, such does not deviate from the fact that petitioner allowed another person to access his account. When he gave his Facebook Messenger password to AAA, he made its contents available to AAA, and the latter would then have the latitude to show to other persons what she could access, whether she be forced to do so or not. The availability of accessing these photos limited the scope of his right to privacy, especially that these became essential in pursuing AAA's claims to protect her rights.\" (Cadajas v. People, G.R.

Stated differently, a State may be said to have descended to the level of an individual and can thus be deemed to have tacitly given its consent to be sued only when it enters into business contracts. It does not apply where the contract relates to the exercise of its sovereign functions. In this case, the projects are an integral part of the naval base which is devoted to the defense of both the United States and the Philippines, indisputably a function of the government of the highest order; they are not utilized for nor dedicated to commercial or business purposes.

It turned out that Flor's TCT No. 23456, although titled prior in time, was based on a survey plan that was married with numerous blatant, obvious, and serious defects, to the point that the trial court found it dubious, irregularly approved and was therefore fake.

In the same case, the Court also emphasized that when an illegitimate child seeks to represent their deceased parents from their grandparents' estate, it is Article 982 that applies. Article 982 provides that grandchildren and other descendants shall inherit by right of representation and the provision makes no distinction whether the grandchildren are legitimate or illegitimate.

","q_answer":"No, the contention of Jhosep is not correct.\n\nThe law provides that those obliged to deliver or to do something incur in delay from the time the obligee judicially or extrajudicially demands from them the fulfillment of their obligation. One exception to the necessity of demand is when the obligation or the law expressly so declares that demand is not necessary. (Civil Code, Article 1169)\n\nThe promissory note expressly provides that upon the debtor's failure to pay the principal amount on December 31, 2015, he agrees to pay a 6% monthly interest from the \"date of default' until the entire obligation is fully paid for. Evidently, the parties agreed that the maturity of the obligation at a date certain, 31 December 2015, will give rise to the obligation to pay interest. The Promissory Note is clear that after 31 December 2015, default commences and the stipulation on payment of interest starts. Therefore, based on the stipulation of the parties, the date of default is January 1, 2016 which is the day following the due date of the obligation on December 31, 2015. Thus, on that date Jhosep became liable for the stipulated interest in the promissory note. (Rivera v. Chua, G.R. No. 184458, January 14, 2015)\n\nIn addition, even on the assumption that there was the absence of extrajudicial demand, Jhosep would still be considered in default from the time of the filing of the collection suit by Mario.\n\nThus, Jhosep is not correct.\n\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\n\nNo, Jhosep is not entirely correct.\n\nUnder the law demand is necessary to put the debtor in default. Article 1169 provides that those obliged to deliver or to do something incur in delay from the time the obligee judicially or extrajudicially demands from them the fulfillment of their obligation. It is clear that the demand which puts the debtor in legal delay may either be judicial or extrajudicial. Since Mario already filed the collection suit against Jhosep on March 1, 2016, the latter is deemed to be in default from that date.\n\nHowever, prior to the filing of the collection suit, Jhosep should not be considered in default. One of the recognized exceptions to the necessity of demand under Article 1169 is when the obligation expressly so states that demand is not necessary to put the debtor in default.\n\nIn the promissory note, there was no categorical statement that default will automatically set in upon the maturity of the obligation on 31 December 2015.

Payment would legally result only after Antonio had foreclosed on said security, sold the same and applied the proceeds thereof to Mauro's loan obligation.

","q_answer":"Yes, the stipulation in the sublease contract is a stipulation pour autrui.\r\n\r\nUnder the principle of relativity, the contract takes effect only between the parties their assigns or their heirs except in case where the rights and obligations arising from the contract are not transmissible by their nature, or by stipulation or by provision of law.\r\n\r\nOne of the recognized exceptions to the principle of relativity of contracts is a stipulation pour autrui. The requisites for such stipulation are the following: (a) the stipulation in favor of a third person, the third-party beneficiary which should be a part, not the whole, of the contract: (b) the contracting parties must have clearly and deliberately conferred a favor upon a third person, not a mere incidental benefit or interest; (c) the favorable stipulations should not be conditioned or compensated by any kind of obligation whatsoever; (d) the third person must have communicated his acceptance to the obligor before its revocation; and (e) neither of the contracting parties bear the legal representation or authorization of the third party.

In the sublease, the lessor is a stranger to the relationship between the lessee and the sublessee. The sublessee has no right or authority to pay the rentals to the lessor because the same is due to the lessee. Thus, when Nardo and Paquito signed the sublease stating that the rentals due from the sublessee Paquito, they conferred a favor upon Nardo who is considered a third party to the sublease and the stipulation is only part and not the whole contract and does not depend on any obligation on the part of Nardo.

Under Article 1544, if the same immovable property be sold to different vendees, the ownership shall belong to the person acquiring it who in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of Property. Should there be no inscription, the ownership shall pertain to the person who in good faith was first in the possession; and, in the absence thereof, to the person who presents the oldest title. provided there is good faith.\r\n\r\nThe prior registration of the disputed property by the second buyer does not by itself confer ownership or a better right over the property. Article 1544 requires that such registration must be coupled with good faith. Knowledge gained by the second buyer of the first sale defeats his rights even if he is first to register the second sale, since such knowledge taints his prior registration with bad faith. This is the price exacted by Article 1544 of the Civil Code for the second buyer being able to displace the first buyer; that before the second buyer can obtain priority over the first, he must show that he acted in good faith throughout.

{"q_question":"Ibrahim borrowed money from Fidel, as evidenced by a loan agreement. Ibrahim used as collateral for the loan his parcel of land situated in Maria Luisa Estate Park in Cebu City. Under the terms of their agreement, Fidel has the exclusive and irrevocable option to buy the collateral for the amount of P100 million, inclusive of the borrowed amount of P50 million and interest therein at 6% per annum. When the loan matured, Ibrahim was unable to pay his loan obligation. Ibrahim, however, refused to sell his collateral to Fidel. May Fidel compel Ibrahim to sell his collateral by exercising the option to buy under the loan agreement? Discuss your answer. ","q_answer":"No, Fidel may not compel Ibrahim to sell his collateral under the Option to Buy.\r\n\r\nUnder the law, the creditor cannot appropriate the things given by way of pledge or mortgage, or dispose of them. Any stipulation to the contrary is null and void. (Civil Code, Article 2088)\r\n\r\nA careful reading of the Exclusive and Irrevocable Option to Buy the Collateral reveals the evident intention of the creditor Fidel, is to appropriate the property given as collateral, for the debtor is obliged to dispose of the collateral at the pre-agreed price a portion of which is the loan already granted to the debtor. In other words, the option assures that Fidel will acquire the mortgaged collateral upon failure of Ibrahim to pay the obligation at maturity and it operates to transfer ownership of the encumbered property to the creditor without availing of the remedy of foreclosure. This is embraced in the concept of pactum commissorium, which is proscribed by law. (Bustamante v. Rosel G.R. No. 126800, November 29, 1999)\r\n\r\nThe mortgagee's consolidation of ownership over the mortgaged property upon the mortgagor's mere failure to pay the obligation is the essence of pactum commissorium. If a mortgagee in equity desires to obtain title to a mortgaged property, the mortgagee's proper remedy is to cause the foreclosure of the mortgage in equity and buy it at a foreclosure sale. (Dacquel v. Sotelo, G.R. No. 203946, August 04, 2021)\r\n\r\nTherefore, Fidel cannot compel Ibrahim to sell by invoking the exclusive option to buy.\r\n","course_name":"Civil Law"},
{"q_question":"Luna owns a passenger bus driven by her employee. Tomas. One day, the passenger bus collided with a car driven by Graciano. Graciano then filed a complaint for damages based on quasi-delict against Luna. He likewise instituted a criminal action against Tomas, but failed to reserve his right to institute a separate civil action for damages in the said criminal case. Luna filed a motion with the trial court for the deferment of trial, arguing that Tomas must be impleaded in the civil case because he committed the negligent act that caused damage to Graciano. Is Luna correct? Explain. ","q_answer":"No, Luna is not correct.\n\nThe same negligent act may produce civil liability arising from a delict under the Revised Penal Code, or may give rise to an action for a quasi-delict under Article 2180 of the Civil Code. An aggrieved party may choose between the two remedies. An action based on a quasi-delict may proceed independently from the criminal action. (Cerezo v. Tuazon, G.R. No. 141538, March 23, 2004)\n\nContrary to the contention of Luna, Tomas need not be impleaded in the case for quasi-delict filed by Graciano. Luna's liability as an employer in an action for a quasi-delict is not only solidary, it is primary and direct. Tomas need not be a party to resolve the case for damages against Luna. Under Article 2194 of the Civil Code, the responsibility of two or more persons who are liable for a quasi-delict is solidary. Where the obligation of the parties is solidary, either of the parties is indispensable and the other is not even a necessary part because complete relief is available from either. (Quiombing v.

Graciano has different and separate causes of action against Luna and Tomas. The cause of action against Luna is based on quasi-delict which is predicated on her own presumed negligence in the selection and supervision of her employee, while the cause of action against Tomas is based on his criminal negligence which resulted in the collision. Under the law, employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business or industry.

However, the plaintiff cannot recover damages twice for the same act or omission of the defendant.\n\nAs employer of Tomas, Luna shall be liable for damages caused by her employee acting within the scope of his assigned task. Since the cause of action against Luna is based on quasi-delict, the civil action may proceed independently of the criminal action but Graciano cannot recover damages twice for the same act or omission.

On September 1, 2024, a weather bulletin warned that super typhoon Enteng will enter the country within three days. On September 4, 2024 at 6:00 a.m., typhoon Enteng and the enhanced southwest monsoon caused massive flooding that rendered major roads in Manila impassable to all kinds of vehicles. Angelica failed to deliver the ring in time for Carlos and Chloe's wedding which pushed through despite the typhoon. Angelica delivered the ring the following day after the flood subsided. Chloe filed against Angelica a complaint for damages. Angelica denied liability and argued that typhoon is a fortuitous event. Chloe replied that typhoon is not a fortuitous event because its arrival was earlier announced. In any event, the typhoon will not exempt Angelica because of her negligence and default. Angelica was negligent when she failed to pay attention to the forecast and was in default when she delivered the ring after the wedding. Is Angelica liable for damages due to default in complying with her obligation? Explain. ","q_answer":"Yes, Angelica is liable for damages for failing to comply with her obligation to deliver the ring.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, demand is necessary to put the debtor in default. (Article 1169, Civil Code) By way of exception, in cases where time is of the essence in an obligation, demand by the creditor would not be necessary and the debtor incurs in delay the moment he or she fails to comply with the obligation. (Ibid.) In the problem presented, it is clear that time was the controlling motive for the establishment of Angelica's obligation to deliver the ring as it will be used for the wedding of Carlos and Chloe. Angelica is aware that the timely delivery of the ring for the occasion is the very reason for the purchase.\r\n\r\nAngelica's argument that she cannot be held liable because a typhoon is a fortuitous event is unmeritorious. To exempt the debtor from liability, one of the requisites is that the event must be unforeseen, or even if foreseen, it is inevitable (Article 1174, Civil Code) and that the debtor must be free from any participation in the aggravation of the injury. Here, the typhoon was not unforeseen as it has already been announced in the weather bulletin as early as September 1. Angelica had ample time to comply with her obligation to deliver the ring prior to the onset of the typhoon. She failed to observe the degree of care. precaution and vigilance which circumstances justly demand despite her knowledge of the oncoming typhoon.

{"q_question":"Viada and Blanco are best friends. In July 2024, Blanco sold to Castan a parcel of land registered in Viada's name. Blanco signed the deed of absolute sale in behalf of Viada and pretended as his agent. In August 2024, Viada executed a special power of attorney (SPA) authorizing Blanco to sell the identical parcel of land. Blanco executed a deed of absolute sale in favor of Sanchez Roman who was aware of the prior conveyance of the same land to Castan. Thereafter, Castan learned of the subsequent transaction between Blanco and Sanchez Roman. Castan then filed against Sanchez Roman an action for annulment of sale. Castan argued that Sanchez Roman is in bad faith because of his knowledge of the prior sale. Sanchez Roman countered that the sale between Blanco and Castan is void for lack of Viada's consent. Castan replied that the subsequent issuance of the SPA to Blanco ratified any defect in their transaction. Who between Castan and Sanchez Roman has a better right over the parcel of land? Explain. ","q_answer":"Sanchez Roman has a better right to the land. When a sale of a piece of land or any interest therein is through an agent, the authority of the latter shall be in writing; otherwise, the sale shall be void. (Article 1874, Civil Code) At the time of the sale, Blanco has no authority from Viada to sell the latter's land and therefore the sale made by Blanco to Castan is void as the seller has absolutely no right over the property sold either as owner or as an agent.\r\n\r\nA void contract produces no effect either against or in favor of anyone. (Alcantara v. Nido G.R. No. 165133; April 19, 2010) The subsequent execution of the SPA in favor of Blanco will not ratify the sale made by the latter to Castan because a void contract cannot be ratified.\r\n\r\nThe rule on double sales particularly on the alleged bad faith of the second buyer will not apply because in double sales it is required that the two or more sales transactions must constitute valid sales. (Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority v. Tirol 588 SCRA 635 (2009) Here, it is clear that the sale made to Castan is void.\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\r\n\r\nSanchez Roman has a better right over the parcel of land. This is because the sale entered into by Blanco in favor of Castan was without authority of Viada. The law provides that no one may contract in the name of another without being authorized by the latter, or unless he has by law a right to represent him. A contract entered into in the name of another by one who has no authority or legal representation, or who has acted beyond his powers, shall be unenforceable, unless it is ratified expressly or impliedly, by the person on whose behalf it has been executed, before it is revoked by the other contracting party.

Alice countered that the prescriptive period to reconvey real property based on an implied trust is 10 years reckoned when she repudiated the trust in 2003 upon the issuance of certificate of title in her name. Thus, Sheila's action for reconveyance filed only in 2024 had already prescribed. Is Sheila's cause of action to recover her share in the property from Alice already prescribed?

(Article 1456, Civil Code) As a rule, the prescriptive period for the reconveyance of fraudulently registered real property is ten (10) years reckoned from the date of the issuance of the certificate of title. This ten-year prescriptive period begins to run from the date the adverse party repudiates the implied trust. which repudiation takes place when the adverse party registers the land. An exception to this rule is when the party seeking reconveyance based on implied or constructive trust is in actual, continuous, and peaceful possession of the property involved.

Sheena denied liability and argued that her obligation was already extinguished when Colet substituted her as lessee. Sheena added that Maloi accepted rental payments from Colet. Did novation extinguish Sheena's obligation under the contract of lease? Explain. ","q_answer":"No, novation did not extinguish Sheena's obligation. Novation of an obligation by substituting the person of the debtor, entails the replacement of the debtor by a third person. To effect novation by substitution of debtor, it is not enough that the debtor merely assigns his debt to another because the law requires that the creditor must consent to release the original debtor. Article 1293 of the Civil Code provides that novation which consists in substituting a new debtor in the place of the original one, may be made even without the knowledge or against the will of the latter, but not without the consent of the creditor. Payment by the new debtor gives him the rights mentioned in articles 1236 and 1237.\r\n\r\nHere, it cannot be assumed that Maloi agreed to release Sheena from liability under the lease contract when she accepted rental payments from Colet. Other than the acceptance of rental payments from Colet, the facts did not state that Maloi had expressly agreed to release Sheena and to accept Colet as the new debtor. Therefore, Sheena's obligation was not extinguished by novation. (Foodfest Land Inc. vs. Siapno, G.R. No. 226088. February 27, 2019)\r\n\r\nALTERNATIVE ANSWER:\r\n\r\nYes, the obligation of Sheena was extinguished by novation.\r\n\r\nFor novation to take place, the following requisites must be present:\r\n\r\na) There must be a previous valid obligation;\r\n\r\nb) An agreement of all parties concerned to a new contract:\r\n\r\nc) The extinguishment of the old obligation;\r\n\r\nd) The birth of a valid new obligation.\r\n\r\nWhen Sheena assigned her rights to Colet. Maloi did not interpose any objection and in fact impliedly gave her consent to Colet being the new lessee when she (Maloi) accepted rental payments from Colet for about three (3) years.

In July 2024, Kiko sent to Jackie a letter which reads: \"I am giving you the first opportunity to buy the leased property for PHP 1,000,000.00. You have until the expiration of the lease contract within which to decide.\" Immediately, Jackie informed Kiko that she will buy the leased property for PHP 800,000.00. Kiko did not reply to Jackie. In August 2024, Jackie learned that Kiko sold the leased property to Bogs for PHP 800,000.00. Aggrieved, Jackie filed an action against Kiko and Bogs to rescind their contract of sale. Jackie claimed that the sale transaction violated her right of first refusal, and that she must be allowed to buy the property at a similar price of PHP 800,000.00. Can Jackie rescind the contract of sale between Kiko and Bogs for the alleged violation of her right of first refusal? Explain.","q_answer":"No, Jackie cannot rescind the contract of sale between Kiko and Bogs. The letter which Kiko sent to Jackie cannot be construed as a right of first refusal since it was not part of the stipulations in their lease contract. Rather, the letter should merely be considered as an offer to sell the land made by Kiko to Jackie or a unilateral promise to sell. (Article 1479, Civil Code)\r\n\r\nUnder the law, when the offerer has allowed the offeree a certain period to accept, the offer may be withdrawn at any time before acceptance by communicating such withdrawal, except when the option is founded upon a consideration, as something paid or promised. (Article 1324, Civil Code) Note that Kiko offered the price of P1,000,000.00 but Jackie made a counter-offer to buy the land for P800,000.00 which was not accepted by Kiko. The contract was, therefore, not perfected between them.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Jackie gave no separate consideration for the exercise of the option to buy the land of Kiko, hence the latter is free to withdraw the offer anytime before acceptance. Kiko was not bound to make another offer to Jackie before offering it to another because the option in favor of Jackie was not supported by a separate cause distinct from the price. Thus, Jackie has no cause of action for rescission since she does not have a right of first refusal.\r\n","course_name":"Civil Law"},
{"q_question":"Klyde and his predecessors-in-interest had been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of a 10-hectare agricultural land of the public domain under a bona fide claim of ownership since 1995. In 2015, the property had been declared alienable and disposable. In 2020. Klyde applied for registration of the lot. The Register of Deeds denied the application because Klyde did not occupy the property since time immemorial or before June 12. 1945. Is the Register of Deeds justified in denying registration of the property in favor of Klyde based on lack of occupation since time immemorial? Explain.  ","q_answer":"Yes, the Register of Deeds is justified in denying registration but not due to the Klyde's non-compliance with the period of possession but because it had no jurisdiction over the registration proceedings which is lodged in the courts. Section 17 of P.D. 1529 provides that he application for land registration shall be filed with the Court of First Instance of the province or city where the land is situated.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that the RD has jurisdiction, the application was still properly denied because Klyde applied for registration in 2020 while the land was released as alienable and disposable only in 2015. Properties classified as alienable public land may be converted into private property by reason of open, continuous and exclusive possession of at least thirty (30) years. (Republic v. Gielczyk G.R. No. 179990; October 23, 2013) With such conversion, such property may now fall within the contemplation of \"private lands\" under Section 14(2), and thus susceptible to registration by those who have acquired ownership through prescription.(Id) However, Klyde's possession prior to the declaration that the land is alienable should not be counted in his favor. From the time that the land was declared alienable in 2015 up to the time that Klyde applied for registration, he has only been in possession for five years and has not acquired the land by prescription.\r\n\r\nThus, his application should be denied.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Republic Act No. 11573 which took effect on September 1, 2021 amended Section 14(1) of P.D. 1529 by shortening the period of possession required to twenty (20) years immediately preceding the filing of the application for confirmation of title. In Republic v. Pasig Rizal Co., Inc. (G.R. No. 213207.

Calista alleged that Sergio's only known relative is his brother, Robert, who lives in Cotabato City. Calista wrote to Robert and asked him about Sergio. Robert replied that he does not have any idea where to find Sergio. Calista also tried to inquire from Sergio's friends but to no avail. Thus, Calista honestly believed that Sergio is already dead.

","q_answer":"There are no compelling reasons to deprive Basha of Kynan's custody.\r\n\r\nKynan was born outside of wedlock and therefore he is illegitimate.

The following grounds have been considered ample justifications to deprive a mother of custody and parental authority: neglect, abandonment, unemployment and immorality, habitual drunkenness, drug addiction, maltreatment of the child, insanity and being sick with a communicable disease. (Perez v. Court of Appeals G.R. No. 118870 March 29, 1996). Here, the supposed lesbian relationship of Basha would not constitute a compelling reason to deprive her of custody of her child.

Nicholas asked the heirs of Sharon to execute an amended deed of donation over the flat terrain but was refused. Nicholas filed against the heirs of Sharon an action for reformation of instrument to reflect the real intention of the parties. May the trial court compel the heirs of Sharon to reform the instrument and execute an amended deed of donation? Explain. ","q_answer":" No, the trial court may not compel the heirs of Sharon to reform the instrument.\r\n\r\nReformation of instrument is a remedy in equity by means of which a written instrument is made or construed so as to express or conform to the real intention of the parties when some error or mistake has been committed. It is only proper if there has been a meeting of the minds of the parties to a contract, but their true intention is not expressed in the instrument purporting to embody the agreement, by reason of mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct or accident.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the law specifically provides that there shall be no reformation in case of simple donations inter vivos wherein no condition is imposed. (Article 1366, Civil Code) This is so because a donation is a mere act of liberality on the part of the donor and his unilateral act. While acceptance is required of the donee, the latter's concurrence as to the amount of property donated is not required and therefore the requirement of meeting of the minds is not present. \r\n","course_name":"Civil Law"},

Will the rules on double sale apply? Explain. ","q_answer":"No, the rules on double sale will not apply. The rules on double sale will apply only if the following requisites are present:\r\n\r\na) The two or more sales transactions must constitute valid sales;\r\n\r\nb) The two or more sales transactions must pertain to the exactly the same subject matter;\r\n\r\nc) The two (or more) buyers at odds over the rightful ownership of the subject matter must each represent conflicting interests; and\r\n\r\nd) The two (or more) buyers are at odds over the rightful ownership of the subject matter must each have bought from the very same seller. (Spouses German vs. Spouses Santuyo, G.R. No. 210845, January 22, 2020)\r\n\r\nThe agreement between Odrey and Jeboy is not a contract of sale but a mere contract to sell as the former has not yet agreed to transfer ownership to Jeboy but only promised to do so upon Jeboy's full payment of the purchase price.

It is only upon the existence of the contract of sale that the seller becomes obligated to transfer the ownership of the thing sold to the buyer. Prior to the existence of the contract of sale, the seller is not obligated to transfer the ownership to the buyer, even if there is a contract to sell between them. Hence, there being no sale in favor of Jeboy. he cannot successfully claim a better right than Lorenz because the rules on double sales are not applicable if the first agreement is a mere contract to sell.

MC allegedly failed to pay the remaining 50% of the contract price despite repeated demands by SC. During trial, SC admitted filing a prior collection suit against another company in the RTC. Hence, MC filed a motion to dismiss the case on the ground that contrary to its allegation, SC was in fact doing business in the Philippines without a license and thus had no legal capacity to sue. Will the motion of MC prosper? Explain.","q_answer":"The motion to dismiss will not prosper. SC's act of entering into a contract with MC does not fall into the category of an isolated transaction.

SMI argued that the Nova Family cannot continue to operate NNI without reviving its corporate existence.Is the Nova Family's continued operations of NNI valid? Explain. ","q_answer":"Nova Family's continued operations of NNI are valid. With the enactment of the Revised Corporation Code (RCC), corporations organized prior to the effectivity of the RCC, are deemed extended and amended to perpetual existence, unless the corporation, upon a vote of its stockholders representing a majority of its outstanding capital stock, notifies the SEC that it elects to retain its specific corporate term pursuant to its articles of incorporation (Section 11, RCC) The automatic conversion of the corporate term to perpetual existence does not require an amendment of the Articles of Incorporation. (SEC-OGC Opinion, no. 28-19, July 19, 2019). The facts do not indicate that NNI elected to retain its specific corporate term. At any rate, the option to retain the term of the corporation, pursuant to the two-year transition period under the RCC expired last February 23, 2021.

By selling its product much lower that its competitors, GPI abused its dominant position. Abuse of dominant position refers to actions of a dominant player to exploit its dominant position in the relevant market or to exclude competitors in a manner that harms the competing process. GPI's action amounted to predatory pricing which is pricing goods or services at such low level that other suppliers cannot compete and forced to leave the market. While it is not illegal to have a dominant position in the market, it is illegal to abuse one's dominance.

At the trial, Phoebe argued that she should be acquitted of the charge because she did not participate in the illegal wildlife trading. Is Phoebe criminally liable for money laundering? Explain. ","q_answer":"Yes, Phoebe is criminally liable for money laundering. Money laundering is a crime whereby the proceeds of an unlawful activity are transacted making them appear to have originated from legitimate sources.

Did the OPB validly refuse to disclose the conspirator's bank records? Explain.","q_answer":"OPB did not validly refuse to disclose the conspirator's bank account. One of the exceptions to the rule against unauthorized disclosure and examination of bank deposits is the issuance of a court order where the subject matter of litigation is the money deposited. The inquiry into bank deposits must be premised on the fact that the money deposited in the account is the subject matter of the action. The Supreme Court has held that the exceptions under R.A No. 1405 allow the disclosure of bank accounts and deposits where the allegedly illegally acquired money is deposited. Guided by the foregoing, it is plain that the account of the conspirator is the subject matter of litigation, as the inquiry is directed at the whereabouts and recovery of the money that had allegedly been illegally acquired.

The law on secrecy of Philippine currency bank deposits (R.A. 1405) prohibits disclosure, examination and inquiry into Philippine currency bank deposits but subject to certain exceptions. Relevant to the facts of the case is where the money deposited or invested is the subject matter of the litigation. In Union Bank v. Court of Appeals,  the Supreme Court noted that the inquiry will be allowed if the money deposited is the itself the subject matter of litigation. In this case, Justin seeks to recover the money withdrawn by the impostor against OPB. His action was directed against the bank and not against the impostor who opened an account with OPB. Thus, it is apparent that Justin is seeking to recover the mere money equivalent of his deposits illegally withdrawn and not the money itself that is already long gone in the hands of the impostor. For this reason, the money deposited by the impostor is not the subject matter of litigation. The exception provided in the law is not present in this case and thus, the inquiry ordered by the RTC is improper. (The REAL BANK (A THRIFT BANK), Inc. V. Dalmacio Cruz Maningas, G.R.

M regarding the kickback is presumed confidential because it was made on account of the prospective lawyer-client relationship. Matters disclosed by a prospective client to a lawyer are protected by the rule on privileged communication in order for the prospective client to feel free to discuss whatever he wishes with the lawyer without fear that what he tells the lawyer will be divulged or used against him, and for the lawyer to be equally free to obtain information from the prospective client.\r\n\r\n(b) When the lawyer discovers that his client committed fraud upon a person or tribunal, the lawyer must still keep such information confidential. Since the information was discovered at a time when there was an existing client-lawyer relationship, all information discovered or disclosed during such time is considered privileged communication. The lawyer cannot divulge the information since he is expected to act with candor, fairness, and loyalty in all his dealings with his clients (Canon 21, Rule 21.01, Code of Professional Responsibility).","course_name":"Legal & Judicial Ethics"},

{"q_question":"The Regional Trial Court (RTC) rendered a decision against Kat. She received a copy of the decision on December 26, 2021. Kat's counsel filed with the Supreme Court a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 by registered mail on January 10, 2022. The petition was dismissed for failure to pay the docket fees within the reglementary period. Kat's counsel challenged the dismissal arguing that: (i) the intention was to pay the docket fees after the same is assessed upon the court's receipt of the petition by registered mail; and (ii) the dismissal of the petition effectively rendered nugatory a party's statutory right to appeal by registered mail under the rules. Kat's counsel also added that she did not want to include cash money in the mail.\r\n\r\nIs Kat's counsel correct?

{"q_question":"Police officers Miggy and Laida were involved in an alleged buy-bust operation against Mr. Magtalas, a suspected drug dealer. Mr. Magtalas maintained his innocence, asserting that the drugs were merely planted. He further claimed that he was unjustifiably beaten up by the police officers.
